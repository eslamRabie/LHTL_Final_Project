***

* As you first begin looking at a chapter or section of a book that teaches concepts of math or science, it helps to take
a “picture walk” through the chapter, glancing not only at the graphics, diagrams, and photos, but also at the section
headings, summary, and even questions at the end of the chapter, if the book has them.

*	The two	different types	of	networks that the brain	switches between : 
    * focused mode (highly attentive states) and 
    * diffuse mode ( more relaxed resting state networks).

* focused mode : It	involves	a	direct	approach	to
solving	problems	using	rational,	sequential,	analytical approaches.

* The	focused	mode	is	associated	with
the	concentrating	abilities	of	the	brain’s	prefrontal	cortex,	located	right	behind	your	forehead.

* The	diffuse	mode	seems	less	affiliated	with	any	one	area	of	the	brain
—you	can	think	of	it	as	being	“diffused”	throughout	the	brain

* Einstellung
effect (pronounced EYE-nshtellung). In this phenomenon, an idea you already have in mind, or your
simple initial thought, prevents a better idea or solution from being found.

* one significant mistake students sometimes make in learning math and
science is jumping into the water before they learn to swim. In other words, they blindly start
working on homework without reading the textbook, attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or
speaking with someone knowledgeable.

    * It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in the focused-mode pinball machine without paying any real attention to where the solution truly lies.


* "If you are trying to understand or figure out something new, your best bet is to turn off your
precision-focused thinking and turn on your “big picture” diffuse mode."

* The harder you push your brain to come up with something
creative, the less creative your ideas will be.

* Ultimately, this means that relaxation is an important part of hard work—and good work, for that matter.

*Shaun Wassell, freshman, computer engineering*

In Humans splitting of brain functions as:

* The left side of the brain is somewhat more associated with careful, focused attention. It also seems more specialized for handling sequential information and logical thinking—the first step leads to the second step, and so on. 
  
* The right seems more tied to diffuse scanning of the environment and interacting with other people, and
seems more associated with processing emotions.
It also is linked with handling simultaneous, big-
picture processing.

* Research indicates that is simply not true. Instead it is clear that both hemispheres are involved in
focused as well as diffuse modes of thinking, But the ***Right*** is more **Diffusion Oriented** and the ***Left*** are more **Focus Oriented** .
***

* ###To learn about and be creative in math and science, we need to strengthen and use both the focused and diffuse modes

* Evidence suggests that to grapple with a difficult problem, we must first put hard, focused-mode
effort into it. (We learned that in grade school!) Here’s the interesting part: The diffuse mode is also
often an important part of problem solving, especially when the problem is difficult. But as long as
we are consciously focusing on a problem, we are blocking the diffuse mode.

## EMBRACE BEFUDDLEMENT!:

* “Befuddlement is a healthy part of the learning process. When students approach a problem and don’t know how to
do it, they’ll often decide they’re no good at the subject. Brighter students, in particular, can have difficulty in this way
—their breezing through high school leaves them no reason to think that being confused is normal and necessary.
But the learning process is all about working your way out of confusion. Articulating your question is 80 percent of the
battle. By the time you’ve figured out what’s confusing, you’re likely to have answered the question yourself!”

*Kenneth R. Leopold, Distinguished Teaching Professor, Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota*

##Procrastination :

* ###when you procrastinate, you are leaving yourself only enough time to do superficial focused-mode learning.
* You are also increasing your stress level because you know you have to complete what feels like an unpleasant task.

* _**" The resulting neural patterns will be faint and fragmented and will quickly disappear—you’ll be
left with a shaky foundation. In math and science in particular, this can create severe problems. If you
cram for a test at the last minute or quickly breeze through your homework, you won’t have time for
either learning mode to help you tackle the tougher concepts and problems or to help you synthesize
the connections in what you are learning "**_

#SUMMING IT UP: 

* Our brain uses two very different processes for thinking—the focused and diffuse modes. It seems you toggle back and forth between these modes, using one or the other.

* It is typical to be stumped by new concepts and problems when we first focus on them.

* To figure out new ideas and solve problems, it’s important not only to focus initially, but
also to subsequently turn our focus away from what we want to learn.

* The Einstellung effect refers to getting stuck in solving a problem or understanding a concept as a result of becoming fixated on a flawed approach. Switching modes from focused to diffuse can help free you from this effect. Keep in mind, then, that sometimes you will need to be flexible in your thinking. You may need to switch modes to solve a problem or understand a concept. Your initial ideas about problem solving can sometimes be very misleading.
