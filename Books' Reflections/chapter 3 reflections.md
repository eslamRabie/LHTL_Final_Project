#Chapter 3  Reflections :
---

* Once you are distracted from the problem at hand, the diffuse mode has access and can
begin pinging about in its big-picture way to settle on a solution.

* Creativity Is about Harnessing and Extending Your Abilities.
* 
* Enlisting the diffuse mode helps you learn at a deep and creative level.

* Every time you relax and think of nothing in particular, your brain enters into a
natural default mode that’s a form of diffuse thinking.

* Sleep is probably the most effective and important factor in allowing your diffuse mode to tackle
a difficult problem.

* In other words, just using your diffuse mode doesn’t mean you can lollygag around and expect to get
anywhere.
    * *"As the days and weeks pass, it’s the distributed practice—the back and forth between
focused-mode attention and diffuse-mode relaxation—that does the trick."*

* ###USE THESE DIFFUSE-MODE TOOLS AS REWARDS AFTER FIRM FOCUSED-MODE WORK :
    * General Diffuse-Mode Activators
        * Go to the gym
        * Play a sport like soccer or basketball
        * Jog, walk, or swim
        * Dance
        * Go for a drive (or tag along for the ride)
        * Draw or paint
        * Take a bath or shower
        * Listen to music, especially without words
        * Play songs you know well on a musical instrument
        * Meditate or pray
        * Sleep (the ultimate diffuse mode!)



    * The following diffuse-mode activators are best used briefly, as rewards. (These activities may pull you into a more
focused mode than the preceding activities.)
        * Play video games
        * Surf the web
        * Talk to friends
        * Volunteer to help someone with a simple task
        * Read a relaxing book
        * Text friends
        * Go to a movie or play
        * Television (dropping a remote if you fall asleep doesn’t count)

##Avoid Einstellung (Getting Stuck) :

* ###**Remember, accepting the first idea that comes to mind when you are working on an assignment or test problem can prevent you from finding a better solution.**

* According to recent research, blinking is a vital activity that provides another means of reevaluating a situation. Closing our eyes seems to provide a micro-pause that momentarily deactivates our attention and allows us, for the briefest of moments, to refresh and renew our consciousness and perspective.

* ***Deliberately closing our eyes may help us focus more deeply.***

* Figuring out a difficult problem or learning a new concept almost always requires one or more periods when you aren't consciously working on the problem.

##ALTERNATING FOCUSED AND DIFFUSE THINKING 

* *** “As a piano player for a decade and a half, I sometimes found myself facing a particularly difficult run. I just couldn’t
get it, so I would force my fingers to do it over and over again (albeit very slowly or incorrectly), and then I’d take a
break. The next day when I tried it again, I would be able to play it perfectly, as if by magic.***

* ***“I tried taking a break today with a calculus problem that was tricky and was starting to infuriate me. In the car on
the way to the Renaissance festival, it came to me and I had to write it on a napkin before I forgot! (Always have
napkins in your car. You never know.)”***


*" Trevor Drozd, junior, computer science "*

---

* The resting times between your focused-mode efforts should be long enough to get your conscious mind completely off the problem you’re working on. Usually a few hours is long enough for the diffuse mode to make significant progress **but not so long that its insights fade away before being passed on to the focused mode.** A good rule of thumb, when you are first learning new concepts, is not
to let things go untouched for longer than a day.

---
##What to Do When You’re Really Stumped :
* People with strong self-control can have the most difficulty in getting themselves to turn off their focused mode so that the diffuse mode can begin its work.

* Make it a rule to listen to study partners, friends, or loved ones
who can sense when you are becoming dangerously frustrated. Sometimes it’s easier to listen to someone else than to yourself.

* Speaking of talking to other people, when you’re genuinely stuck, nothing is more helpful than getting insight from classmates, peers, or the instructor. Ask someone else for a different perspective
on how to solve the problem or a different analogy to understand the concept; however, it’s best that you first wrestle with the problem yourself before you talk to anyone else, because it can embed the
basic concepts deeply enough that you become receptive to the explanation.
    * **Learning often means making sense of what we’ve ingested, and for that, we need to have ingested something.**

## FAILURE CAN BE A GREAT TEACHER :

* *** “When I was in tenth grade I decided to take an AP computer science class. I ended up failing the AP exam. But I would not accept the failure, so I took the class and the test again the following year. Somehow, staying away from programming for nearly a year and then coming back to it made me realize how much I truly enjoyed it. I passed the test easily on the second try. If I had been too afraid of failure to take the computer science class the first time, and then a second time, I would certainly not be what I am today, a passionate and happy computer scientist.” ***

*assandra Gordon, sophomore, computer science*

##Understand the Paradoxes of Learning : 

* Learning is often paradoxical. The very thing we need in order to learn impedes our ability to learn. We need to focus intently to be able to solve problems—yet that focus can also block us from accessing the fresh approach we may need. Success is important, but critically, so is failure. Persistence is key—but misplaced persistence causes needless frustration.

## Introduction to Working and Long-Term Memory :

* **Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you are immediately and consciously processing in your mind.**



* **long-term memory might be thought of as a storage warehouse.**
    * large, with room for billions of items, and it can be easy for stored parcels to get buried so deeply that it’s difficult to retrieve them.
    * when your brain first puts an item of information in long-term memory, you need to revisit it a few times to increase the chances you’ll later be able to find it when you need it.

* It takes time to move information from working memory to long-term memory.    
    * To help with this process, use a technique called ***spaced repetition*** :
        * this technique involves repeating what you are trying to retain, like a new vocabulary word or a new problem-solving technique, but spacing this repetition out over a number of days.

##Let Your Mind Work in the Background :
The next time you are tackling a tough problem, work on it for a few minutes. When you get stuck, move on to
another problem. Your diffuse mode can continue working on the tougher problem in the background. When you later
return to the tougher problem, you will often be pleasantly surprised by the progress you’ve made.

---
##ADVICE ON SLEEPING : 

***“Many people will tell you that they can’t nap. The one thing I learned from a single yoga class I took many years ago
was to slow down my breathing. I just keep breathing slowly in and out and don’t think I must fall asleep. Instead, I
think things like, Sleepytime! and just focus on my breathing. I also make sure it’s dark in the room, or I cover my
eyes with one of those airplane sleep masks. Also, I set my phone alarm for twenty-one minutes because turning a
short power nap into a longer sleep can leave you groggy. This amount of time gives me what’s basically a cognitive
reboot.”***

*Amy Alkon, syndicated columnist and catnap queen*

---
## The Importance of Sleep in Learning :

* **prolonged sleeplessness is lethal.**

* It seems that if you go over the material right before taking a nap or going to sleep for the evening, you have an increased chance of dreaming about it.

    * Dreaming about what you are studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand—it somehow consolidates your memories into easier-to-grasp chunks.

* ***Going without sleep the night before an examination can mean that even if you are perfectly prepared, your mind is simply unable to function properly, so you do poorly on the test.***

---
##A METHOD FOR MANY DISCIPLINES : 

Focused and diffuse approaches are valuable for all sorts of fields and disciplines, not just math and science. As Paul Schwalbe, a senior majoring in English, notes:

***“If I have trouble working on a problem, I lie down in my bed with an open notebook and pen and just write out thoughts about the problem as I fall asleep, as well as sometimes right after waking up. Some of what I write makes no sense, but sometimes I gain a totally new way of looking at my problem.”***

#SUMMING IT UP :
* Use the focused mode to first start grappling with concepts and problems in math and science.

- After you’ve done your first hard focused work, allow the diffuse mode to take over. Relax and do something different!

- When frustration arises, it’s time to switch your attention to allow the diffuse mode to beginworking in the background.

- It’s best to work at math and science in small doses—a little every day. This gives both the focused and diffuse modes the time they need to do their thing so you can understand what you are learning. That’s how solid neural structures are built.

- If procrastination is an issue, try setting a timer for twenty-five minutes and focusing intently on your task without allowing yourself to be drawn aside by text messages, web surfing, or other attractive distractions.

- Spaced repetition helps move items from working memory to long-term memory.

- There are two major memory systems: 
    - Working memory—like a juggler who can keep only four items in the air.
    - Long-term memory—like a storage warehouse that can hold large amounts of material, but needs to be revisited occasionally to keep the memories accessible.


- Sleep is a critical part of the learning process. It helps you:
    - Make the neural connections needed for normal thinking processes-which is why sleep the night before a test is so important.
    - Figure out tough problems and find meaning in what you are learning. 
    - Strengthen and rehearse the important parts of what you are learning and prune away trivialities.
