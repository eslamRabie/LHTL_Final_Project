# Chapter 4 Chunking :
---
### In this chapter, we’ll be talking about precisely what that problem is—involving how focus links to both understanding and memory.

Using recall—mental retrieval of the key ideas—rather than passive rereading will make your study time more focused and effective.
* Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning.
* one of the first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks—mental leaps that unite separate bits of information through meaning.
* __chunk : the ability to understand and work a certain type of math or science problem__.
* The one concern about using worked-out examples to form chunks is that it can be all too easy to focus too much on why an individual step works and not on the connection between steps—that is, on why this particular step is the next thing you should do.

#steps of chunking :

---
 1. The first step in chunking, is to simply focus your attention on the information you want to chunk.
 
 2. The second step in chunking is to understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk:
    * basic understanding—synthesizing the gist of what’s
important
    * Understanding is like a superglue that helps hold the underlying memory traces together.
    * It creates broad, encompassing traces that link to many memory traces
    *  Can you create a chunk if you don’t understand? Yes, but it’s a useless chunk that won’t fit in with other material you are learning.
    *  __Just understanding how a problem was solved does not necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later__

    * *** Do not confuse understanding with solid expertise, you can grasp an idea when a teacher presents it in class, but if you don’t review it fairly soon after you’ve first learned it, Closing the book and testing yourself on how to solve the problems will also speed up your learning at this stage.***

3.  The third step to chunking is gaining context so you see not just how, but also when to use this chunk.
    *  Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more 
broadly,you see not only when to use the chunk, but when not to use it.

### Learning takes place in two ways:
* A bottom-up chunking process where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily gain access to it when needed. 
* A  top-down “big picture” process that allows you to see where what you are learning fits in.
* Context is where bottom-up and top-down learning meet.

## Illusions of Competence and the Importance of Recall :
* ***Attempting to recall the material you are trying to learn—retrieval practice—is far more effective than simply rereading the material.***

* Intention to learn is helpful only if it leads to the use of good learning strategies.

* ***When marking up the text, train yourself to look for main ideas before making any marks, and keep your text markings to a minimum— one sentence or less per paragraph.***

    * Words or notes in a margin that synthesize key concepts are a good idea.

* Using recall—mental retrieval of the key ideas—rather than passive rereading will make your study time more focused and effective. 

* The only time rereading text seems to be effective is if you let time pass between rereadings so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition.


* ##*** A key difference between creative scientists and technically competent but non-imaginative ones is their breadth of interest.***

* The bigger your chunked mental library, the more easily you will be able to solve problems.

### There are two ways to solve problems:
 
* First, through sequential, step-by-step reasoning:
    * Sequential thinking, where each small step leads deliberately toward the solution, involves the focused mode.
    
* Second, through more holistic intuition :
    * Intuition, on the other hand, often seems to require a creative, diffuse mode linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts.
    
***"Most difficult problems are solved through intuition, because they make a leap away from what you are familiar with"***

*  Keep in mind that the diffuse mode’s semi-random way of making connections means that the solutions it provides with should be carefully verified using the focused mode. *** Intuitive insights aren’t always correct! ***

#Practice Makes Permanent :

* When we retrieve knowledge, we’re not being
mindless robots—the retrieval process itself enhances deep learning and helps us begin forming chunks.


* You can’t learn mathematics or science without also including a healthy dose of practice and repetition	to	help you build the chunks that will underpin your	expertise.

* In the same amount of time, by simply practicing and recalling the material, students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach, including simply rereading the text a number of times or drawing concept maps that supposedly enriched the relationships in the materials under study. This improved learning comes whether students take a formal test or just informally test themselves.

#Recall	Material	While	Outside	Your	Usual	Place	of	Study:	The	Value	of	Walking

* Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study helps you strengthen your grasp of the material by viewing it from a different perspective.

* If you don’t practice with your growing chunks, it is harder to put together the big picture—the	pieces are simply too faint.

## Interleaving—Doing a Mixture of Different Kinds of Problems—versus Overlearning

* Interleaving means practice by doing a mixture of different kinds of problems requiring different strategies.

* Continuing the study or practice after it is well understood is called overlearning.

* Overlearning can help produce an automaticity that is important when you are executing a serve in tennis or playing a perfect piano concerto. But be wary of repetitive overlearning during a single session in math and science learning —research has shown it can be a waste of valuable learning time.

* Revisiting the approach mixed with other approaches during a subsequent study session, however, is just fine.

* EMPHASIZE INTERLEAVING INSTEAD OF OVERLEARNING.

* Overlearning refers to a learning strategy in which a student continues to study or practice immediately after some criterion has been achieved.
    *  ***An example might be correctly solving a certain kind of math problem and then immediately working several more problems of the same kind. Although working more problems of the same kind (rather than fewer) often boosts scores on a subsequent test, doing too many problems of the same kind in immediate succession provides diminishing returns.***
